Very brief notes on extracting data

CDM:

use all_entities_Genome, all_entities_Feature, all_entities_Taxonomy
to get tables
run Flatten script to combine to one
run Split script on combined feature file for easier solr loading
(need to generate scientific_name_sort field)

run collate script with domain files to add to split files
run smartpaste script with external id files to add to split files
(need notes on generating these files)
